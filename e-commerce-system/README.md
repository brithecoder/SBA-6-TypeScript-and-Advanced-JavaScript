### TypeScript and Advanced JavaScript

This application displays knowledge of TypeScript and JavaScript also making GET request to API.
If you want to see the application in DOM run the index.html file in live server.To be honest I worked I worked on getting the array of products displayed in the DOM for majority of the time, as for me ,this was the 
most satisfying part of executing this project.It was tricky because we haven’t gotten to this part in the lessons yet but after a few hours of troubleshooting and refactoring I was able to display the information in the DOM. At first I was going to try to do everything through the console/ terminal and it was working fine but I wanted to challenge myself.

 My preference is vanilla JS with React but I can see the advantages of Typescript especially when working on enterprise level projects.I was nervous when I seen the build artifacts show up and thought to delete them but it seems every-time I compiled the project the artifacts would show up. I looked into if it was okay to commit to GitHub but I found out how to add artifact files to .gitingore file. This was very helpful. I really enjoyed building this project and utilizing my previous and new found skills. 

 I handled the asynchronous code by making sure that the GET FETCH function utilized async/await I also added the finally statement after the main function had ran so I knew that the call to the API was successful and the data was being parsed correctly. 
 I tried to make sure the errors reflected if it was a data issue or network issue. To help me understand how the async/ await was working I console.log when I was starting the the project what the data that was being returned from the fetch looked like and when the application ended.
